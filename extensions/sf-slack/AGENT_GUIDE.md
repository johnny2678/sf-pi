# SF Slack Agent Guide

Use SF Slack for Slack research, thread/history lookup, channel/user/file/canvas reads, and explicitly requested collaboration writes.

## Research

1. Use `slack_time_range` for relative dates; pass its boundaries through unchanged.
2. Use `slack_resolve` for fuzzy channels or people. Confidence below 0.85 requires clarification.
3. When the user supplies a canonical Slack message permalink, preserve it in `slack` thread `message_url`; do not reduce it to a raw channel ID and timestamp.
4. Prefer `slack_research` for natural-language research and strict-to-broad query fallback.
5. Start with preview or summary fields. Fetch full messages/threads only for high-value results.
6. Use thread context when `reply_count` indicates discussion.

## Writes

- Call `slack_send` only when the user explicitly asked in the current turn.
- If exact wording is absent, draft before opening the confirmation dialog.
- Preserve supplied wording and never add signatures or via-SF-Pi footers.
- Use `slack_schedule` only for explicitly requested future delivery; schedule/delete remains human-confirmed.
- Canvas create/edit is a durable write and remains Guardrail-mediated.

## Public artifacts

Slack is research-only for public repository output. Distill concepts, then write fresh generic examples without names, channels, permalinks, customer details, internal ids, or non-public wording.
